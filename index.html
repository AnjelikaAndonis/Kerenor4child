	<p>"Keren Or for Child" - It is a non-profit organization that serves seriously ill children and their families around the world.
	<br>There is a volunteer representative office in Israel founded on medical centers: Ichilov-Surassky, Shiba-Tel Ha Shomer, Schneider, Rambam, and Hadassah. 
	<br>We do not limit ourselves to the framework of a certain disease, but oftentimes, we are talking specifically about oncology.

	<h4 class="maroon">Fund history</h4>
	<p>Our charitable activity began during the coronavirus epidemic.
	The pandemic left many children from the CIS countries treated in Israel without medical and financial assistance.
	At that time, we had to help families find funding for treatment, living, buying medicines and food.
	At first, we applied to various structures and charitable foundations, but this gave unsatisfactory results.
	We came to the conclusion that to help families effectively, we need to obtain official status. At the end of 2020, a charitable foundation was registered.
	From that moment, it began to engage in fundraising activities to treat children and assistance in everyday matters.
	During this period, many volunteers and partners have joined the activities of the foundation, whom we appreciate and endlessly thank. 
	The main part of our team was formed from ordinary people who left their work during the coronavirus epidemic. Helpful people began to help us to the best of their ability.
	Today, a wonderful team of drivers, animators, photographers, medical representatives, soldiers, retirees, and the clergy has been created.
